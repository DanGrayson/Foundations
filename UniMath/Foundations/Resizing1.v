  Set Printing Universes.
  Unset Printing Notations.

  Definition raise_type : Type@{i} -> Type@{j}.
  Proof.
    intros T.
    exact T.
  Defined.

  Lemma weq_raise {X : Type@{i}} (x y : X) : @paths@{i} X x y â‰ƒ @paths@{j} (raise_type X) x y.
  Proof.
    simple refine (weqpair _ (gradth _ _ _ _)); intros p; now induction p.
  Defined.
