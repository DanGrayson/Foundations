K-theory
========

Author: Daniel R. Grayson <dan@math.uiuc.edu>

In this subdirectory of "CategoryTheory" we formalize the category theory
useful in higher algebraic K-theory, namely Quillen's theory of exact
categories, as developed here:

* Daniel Quillen, Higher algebraic K-theory. I, Algebraic K-theory, I: Higher
  K-theories (Proc. Conf., Battelle Memorial Inst., Seattle, Wash., 1972),
  Springer, Berlin, 1973, pp. 85–147. Lecture Notes in Math., Vol. 341.

We also follow the careful and efficient exposition presented here:

* Bühler, Theo, Exact categories, Expo. Math. 28 (2010), no. 1, 1–69.
